The user will enter the amount to transfer. 
The program will save each initial balance in separate variables. 
A comparison will be made on both balances after a calculation is made by the test to verify that the balances are what they are supposed to be. 
If they arenâ€™t the transaction will be reversed and an error will be reported, if they are what they should be then the transaction goes through without a problem.
